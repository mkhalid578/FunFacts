# FunFacts
A simple iOS app that shows random facts.

A mobile iOS app created using Swift and XCode. The app is very simple in nature but touches upon many important paradigms within object oriented programming. The app was created through Team Treehouse and everything was taught from scratch (primitive data types, variables, control flow, functions, and object oriented programming). 

## UI Design

The User Interface consists of a simple UIButton and UILabel element which will change as the button is pressed. The background color also changes as you press for a new fact. A user is presented with a "Did You Know" at the top which is simple text element that is given a tint. Each of the elements on the app are provided constraints which allow for continuity across all iOS-enabled devices (iPad, iPhone)
